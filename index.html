            <p> I was born in York PA in 1998 to John and Marie Krueger. Growing up my parents always knew that I would become an engineer and as I got older I found that building and fixing electronics, puzzles, and models was a passion. I attended Northeastern Senior High School and graduated magna cum laude in 2017. While I was there I was involved with the orchestra,  cross country and track team, math club, Quiz Bowl/Brainbusters, and the Robotics team. In my personal time I served as a manager for a band, cinematographer and composer for an award winning short film, and volunteered at my church.</p>
            <p>I am currently a Junior at the Villanova College of Engineering studying Mechanical Engineering with minors in Aerospace Engineering and Math. I am studying to acheive my goals of working in the aerospace industry and furthering the exploration of space.
