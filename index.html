            <p>I was born in York PA in 1998 to John and Marie Krueger. Growing up my parents always knew that I would become an engineer and as I got older I found that building and fixing electronics, puzzles, and models was a passion. I attended Northeastern Senior High School and graduated magna cum laude in 2017. While I was there I was involved with the orchestra, cross country and track team, math club, Quiz Bowl/Brainbusters, and the Robotics team. In my personal time I served as a manager for a band, cinematographer and composer for an award-winning short film, and volunteered at my church.</p>
            <p>I am currently a Junior at the Villanova College of Engineering studying Mechanical Engineering with minors in Aerospace Engineering and Math. I am studying to achieve my goals of working in the aerospace industry and furthering the exploration of space.

        <p>Because I have known what I want to do for a long time, I have made efforts to get involved with opportunities that I enjoy and benefit me professionally.</p>
        <p>In high school I was involved with several clubs that deal with math and engineering. One I was invested in was the robotics team, as first a member and then as the captain for my junior and senior years. We competed in several area VEX robotics competitions and placed in third at one of them.
            I was also a member of the school’s math club, where we participated in regional math challenges and competitions. I always performed well and near the top in most competitions.
            When I graduated I was awarded the Math Department Award for being the top student in that department and the National High School Orchestra Award for outstanding leadership in the orchestra.
        </p>
        <p>
            In college I have tried to give myself practical and research experience that makes me a better, well-rounded individual. Over the summer of 2018 I worked full-time as an intern for a local manufacturing company named Coupling Corporation of America. I not only learned the design process for new couplings and the engineering involved, but also got hand on experience machining, cleaning, and assembling the couplings that were designed. It was a wonderful opportunity to see the full manufacturing process and gave me invaluable experience working in an industrial setting.
            Over the summer of 2019, I worked at Villanova as an undergraduate researcher in the mechanical engineering department. Under the mentorship of a professor, I applied for and was awarded a Villanova Undergraduate Research Fellowship, which provides room, board, and a stipend for summer research. This gave me an incredible opportunity to propose, conduct, and present personal research under the direction of a professor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I have experience outside of the normal skill-set expected of engineers. I am the manager for a band that formed from my friends in high school. With my guidance, they played local venues and created and released a full-length album that is distributed on most major streaming platforms.
            I also served as the cinematographer on another friend’s short film that won the PA state computer fair prize for best short film.
            When he told me that he was working on another short film, I took a larger role and merged my love for music and film into one as the film’s composer. The film performed well enough that two more short films are being planned and include me as the composer.
            Finally, during high school, my friends got me into cross country running, which I competed in my final two years there. Now I run as a hobby, continually lowering my times and raising the bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I always strive to be a well-rounded person who is motivated to do well and enjoy the craft. I hope to take my talents and personality to a deserving company to perform my best and help the company achieve its goals. My resume is displayed to the right and summarizes all the information in this webpage and is available for download. Feel free to contact me if you want more information or wish to speak to me about an opportunity.
